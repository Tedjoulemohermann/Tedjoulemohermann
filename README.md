## I-My data analysis projects with python  
### <a href="https://github.com/Tedjoulemohermann/MES-PROJETS-PYTHON/blob/main/Projet1_analytics_Hermann.ipynb">Project 1 : Public health study with python. </a> 

<b>Situation</b>:
You are integrated into a new team of researchers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), one of the United Nations bodies   whose objective is "to help build a world free from hunger ". Your team is in charge of carrying out a large-scale study on the theme of undernutrition in the world. The problem of hunger is complex and can have multiple causes, which differ from country to country. The preliminary stage of this study will therefore be to establish a "state of the art" of the research already published, but also to carry out a statistical study intended to direct research towards particular countries, and to highlight various causes of hunger. Thus, a handful of data analysts (including you!) have been selected to lead this preliminary step.

<b>Situation</b>: 
Your agri-food business wants to expand internationally. She specializes in chicken. But for the moment, the field of possibilities is very wide: no particular country or continent has been chosen for the moment. All countries are possible! Your objective will be to help target certain countries in particular, with the aim of deepening the market study afterwards. More particularly, the ideal would be to produce "groups" of countries, more or less large, whose we know the characteristics . Initially, the strategy is rather to export the products in the new target country(ies) rather than to produce locally.

### <a href="https://github.com/Tedjoulemohermann/Tedjoulemohermann/blob/main/Projet1_Scientist_Hermann.ipynb">Project 1 : Predicting Credit Card Approvals.</a> 
<b>Situation</b>:
Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

### <a href="https://github.com/Tedjoulemohermann/Tedjoulemohermann/blob/main/Projet2_Scientist_Hermann.ipynb">Project 2 : Naïve Bees: Deep Learning with Images.</a> 

<b>Situation</b>:
Being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like colony collapse disorder threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.This notebook walks through building a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees and then loads a pre-trained model for evaluation.

### <a href="https://github.com/Tedjoulemohermann/Tedjoulemohermann/blob/main/Projet3_Scientist_Hermann.ipynb">Project 3 :  Book Recommendations from Charles Darwin.</a> 

<b>Situation</b>: The purpose of this project is to develop the bases of a content-based book recommendation system, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are. The methods we will use are commonly used in text- or documents-heavy industries such as legal, tech or customer support to perform some common task such as text classification or handling search engine queries.
